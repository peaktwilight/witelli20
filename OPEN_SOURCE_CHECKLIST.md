# Open Source Preparation Checklist

Before publishing this repository as open source, please complete the following checklist:

## Required Actions

- [ ] **Remove Sensitive Information**
  - [x] Create `.env.example` with placeholder values
  - [x] Ensure `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (confirmed it is properly ignored)
  - [ ] Check for any hardcoded secrets or credentials throughout the codebase

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [x] Update README.md with installation and configuration instructions
  - [x] Create CONTRIBUTING.md
  - [x] Add MIT LICENSE file
  - [ ] Take a screenshot of the application and save as `public/screenshot.png`

- [ ] **Code Cleanup**
  - [x] Remove or disable unused features (AI story generator)
  - [x] Update Firebase rules to match the current feature set
  - [ ] Ensure no console.log statements with sensitive data remain
  - [ ] Remove any remaining references to specific individuals or locations
  
- [ ] **Final Review**
  - [ ] Run the application locally to ensure it works with sample configuration
  - [ ] Test Firestore rules to ensure they provide appropriate security
  - [ ] Make sure all links in documentation point to valid destinations

## Optional Enhancements

- [x] Add issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- [x] Create a GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD and releases
- [x] Add version information in the footer
- [x] Set up release process with automated versioning
- [ ] Add badges to README (build status, license, etc.)
- [ ] Set up a demo instance with sample data

## Final Step

- [ ] Delete this checklist file before pushing to GitHub

## Notes

- Consider creating a read-only demo Firebase project that can be used by people wanting to try the application without setting up their own backend.
- Make sure the project name and structure is generic enough to be useful to others beyond your specific use case.
- For security best practices, always keep sensitive information in environment variables and ensure they're not committed to version control.
