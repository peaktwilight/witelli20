# Public Assets

This directory contains public assets for the Witelli20 Student Portal.

## Adding a Screenshot

The project's README references a screenshot image (`screenshot.png`) which should be placed in this directory.

To add a screenshot:

1. Take a screenshot of your application showing the main interface
2. Save it as `screenshot.png` in this directory
3. Make sure the image has a reasonable size (recommended: 1200Ã—630px)
4. Ensure the screenshot shows key features of the application

A good screenshot will help new users and contributors understand the project at a glance.

## Social Preview Image

You can also use your screenshot as a social preview image on GitHub:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll to "Social preview"
3. Upload your screenshot or a custom image

This will make your repository more appealing when shared on social media or other platforms.
